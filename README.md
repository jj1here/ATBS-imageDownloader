# ATBS-imageDownloader

This program goes to imgur enters what you want into the search bar and grabs the top 5 imgs and then creates a folder and adds the images.

The program was alot easier to follow and do using the requests and beautifulSoup modules compared to selenium. Requests and beautifulSoup did everything in the background and was a lot easier to find thing with imgur instead of google. While, Selenium has to open an actual page and takes more time to run. Although both probably have good uses for certain situations.

Finally being able to download the top five pics almost instantly is really cool.
